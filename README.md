I worked on this project individually for the purpose of my Faculty's subject Business Statistics.
Project overview - I was asked to choose a dataset with at least a few hundred tuples and do the following analysis on it:
1. Make a basic quantitative analysis (relative and cumulative frequencies, interval midpoints, mode, median, quantiles, IQR, range)
2. Show a correlation between the data using scatter plots and bar charts
3. Construct a stem-and-leaf plot
4. Calculate dispersion, standard deviation and correlation coefficient
5. Determine a confidence interval, set and test a hypothesis
6. Do a chi-square dispersion test
